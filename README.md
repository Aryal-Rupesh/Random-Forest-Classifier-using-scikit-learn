This repository uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict heart disease based on 13 health-related features. The dataset, containing 303 samples, is split into 75% for training and 25% for testing. The model, with 40 decision trees and a maximum depth of 3, achieves 88.11% accuracy on the training set and 86.84% on the test set. Evaluation metrics, including the confusion matrix, precision, and recall, show the model's effectiveness in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.
